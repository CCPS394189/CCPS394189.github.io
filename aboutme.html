  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>I am working toward getting better at soccer and maintaining a high gpa. I work hard toward these goals because I want to be able to graduate high school and go to a good college. The values I consider most are honesty, responsibility, and integrity. Another good value to have is always being positive and not letting small things get too you. I've learned this especially in sports because I am a competitive person. A short term goal I want to accomplish is being more organized. Since I have a job and I'm a student athlete, I'm always busy. If I get myself into a more organized schedule, it could make it a lot easier. I want to be known as the girl who always tries her best and is always respectful no matter to who.Â </p>
